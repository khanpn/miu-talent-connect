# MIU Talent Connect

## 1. Problem Statement

Students and recent graduates often struggle to secure roles matching their skills, while employers face challenges finding qualified candidates efficiently. Traditional hiring methods are time-consuming and often overlook emerging talent without strong connections.

**MIU Talent Connect bridges this gap by providing:**

- **For Students:** A platform where they can easily create, update, and share their professional profiles with potential employers, enabling them to gain visibility in a competitive job market.

- **For Employers:** A robust search and filtering system that allows them to efficiently locate candidates who match their specific job criteria, saving time and resources in the hiring process.

- **For Universities:** An optional feature that allows educational institutions to verify and endorse student profiles, adding credibility to candidate information and supporting studentsâ€™ job-seeking efforts.
  By bridging the gap between students and employers, this website aims to streamline the recruitment process, increase employment opportunities for students, and provide employers with a diverse pool of qualified candidates.

This centralized platform streamlines recruitment, broadens access to qualified candidates, and increases opportunities for students, creating a win-win for all stakeholders.

  - **2.2 Project Run and Build**

    - To run project, you can open `backend` project and run it from an IDE, or navigate to `backend` directory and run command `mvn spring-boot:run`.
    - To build project `mvn clean package`.

  - **2.3 Deployment**
    - Build project and create a docker image with a provided Dockerfile in project directory.
    - Push docker image to a repository registry (Docker Hub or [Lightsail Container Service Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-pushing-container-images.html)).
    - Follow [Create and manage container service deployments in Lightsail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-container-services-deployments.html) to create a new container service.
    - Provide all `environment variables` mentioned in `Environment Variables` section and start creating new deployment. Below is a screenshot of a successful deployed application on AWS Lightsail.

- **2. Back-End**

  - Create a new Git Actions workflow using a defined `.github/workflows/aws-lightsail.yml` as a reference for automating build and deploy `backend` project to Lightsail Container Service.
  - Refer to `backend/.aws/lightsail-service-config-template.json` for creating input argument for `--cli-input-json` of `aws lightsail create-container-service-deployment` command.
